Hello, my name is David Chen

I’m interested in research in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, ranging from topics such as Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, etc. to Differential Equations
and Computational Math/Modelling

I’m currently studying in my 3B term at the University of Waterloo and pursuing a degree in Mathematical Physics. I am taking/have taken many interesting and relavant courses for research such as 
Quantum Physics 1 & 2 , Ordinary Differential Equations 1 & 2, Partial Differential Equations, Classical Mechanics 1 & 2, Continuum Mechanics etc.

I’m looking to collaborate with professors/research teams where I can gain valuable experience and develop my research skills to become a professional. 

I can be reached at: dh2chen@uwaterloo.ca or by phone at: 343-333-0930
Pronouns: He/Him
